# house-price-prediction
Linear regression is a most suitable technique for the prediction of house prices due to its simplicity and interpretability. It assumes a linear relationship between the independent variables (such as how many bedrooms, number of bathrooms, and square footage) and the dependent variable (house price).
I trained this model on the dataset which is taken from kaggle.com using Linear Regression.
House price prediction can help the developer determine the selling price of a house and can help the customer to arrange the right time to purchase a house.
